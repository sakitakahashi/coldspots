There are three types of scripts in this directory:

**./Code/FunctionsForAnalysis.R** and **./Code/FunctionsForMaps.R**: contain functions to be sourced

**./Code/Analysis_\*.R**: implement analyses (to follow in sequential order); scripts with multiple suffixes (e.g., _UrbanRural) indicate sensitivity analysis

**./Code/Figure_\*.R**: create *.pdf* figures, saved to **./Figures/** (or *.png* figures, saved to **./Movies/**)
