Files are available for download from https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm (with login). The files to download, for each country, are **(1)** the .DTA file of the Children's Recode, and **(2)** the .dbf file of the Geographic Datasets. Once downloaded, create individual directories in ./Data/DHS/ for each country, containing **(1)** and **(2)**. All parts (i.e., the directories and both **(1)** and **(2)**) should be named with the appropriate DHS_code from ./Data/Master_List.csv (e.g., "BY_2010" for Burundi).
